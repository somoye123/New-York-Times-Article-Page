          Alan Guth was one of the first physicists to hypothesize the existence
          of inflation, which explains how the universe expanded so uniformly
          and so quickly in the instant after the Big Bang 13.8 billion years
          ago.Credit... <span>Rick Friedman for The New York Times</span>

              CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young
              physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s appointment
              at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations,
              venturing far beyond the world of known physics.
            </p>
            <p>
              He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic
              particles that should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead
              he discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin
              with. A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution
              could have infused space itself with a special energy that exerted
              a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the
              speed of light for a prodigiously violent instant.
            </p>
            <p>
              If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the
              heavens look uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged,
              warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the
              wrinkles and irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but
              would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.
            </p>
            <p>
              “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the
              page and drew a double box around it.
            </p>
            <p>
              On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported
              that they had seen the beginning of the Big Bang, and that his
              hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.
            </p>
            <p>
              Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to
              <a href="#">he first sliver of cosmic time</a> twith telescopes at
              the South Pole, a team of astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the
              Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics detected ripples in
              the fabric of space-time — so-called
              <a href="#">gravitational waves</a> — the signature of a universe
              being wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of
              a trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. They are the
              long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac
              and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.
            </p>
            <p>
              Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though
              many, including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever be
              proved.
            </p>
            <p>
              If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in
              science comparable to the recent discovery of dark energy pushing
              the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast
              realms of time and space and energy to science and speculation.
            </p>
            <p>
              Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see,
              extending 14 billion light-years in space with its hundreds of
              billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger
              cosmos whose extent, architecture and fate are unknowable.
              Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an endless number
              of other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of
              pasta water boiling over.
            </p>
            <h2>'As Big as It Gets'</h2>
            <p>
              In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces
              operating at energies forever beyond the reach of particle
              accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself.
              Dr. Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct observation of
              gravitational waves, which, according to Einstein’s theory of
              general relativity, should ruffle space-time.
            </p>
            <p>
              Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe
              expert who was not part of the team, said, “This is huge, as big
              as it gets.”
            </p>
            <p>
              He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe,
              sending a telegram encoded in gravitational waves.”
            </p>
            <p>
              The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a
              bath of microwave radiation that permeates space and preserves a
              picture of the universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot
              as the surface of the sun.
            </p>
            <p>
              Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as
              Bicep, for Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic
              Polarization, reported their results in a scientific briefing at
              the Center for Astrophysics here on Monday and in a set of papers
              submitted to The Astrophysical Journal.

          <h3>The Theory of Inflation</h3>
          <p>
            Astronomers have found evidence to support the theory of inflation,
            which explains how the universe expanded so uniformly and so quickly
            in the instant after the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago.

              <span>THE UNIVERSE</span> is just under 14 billion years old. From
              our position in the Milky Way galaxy, we can observe a sphere that
              is now about 92 billion light-years across. But there's a mystery.
              Wherever we look, the universe has an even temperature.

            <p>
              <span>NOT ENOUGH TIME</span> The universe is not old enough for
              light to have traveled the vast distance from one side of the
              universe to the other, and there has not been enough time for
              scattered patches of hot and cold to mix into an even temperature.

            <p>
              <span>DISTANT COFFEE</span> At a smaller scale, imagine using a
              telescope to look a mile in one direction. You see a coffee cup,
              and from the amount of steam, you can estimate its temperature and
              how much it has cooled.

            <p>
              <span>COFFEE EVERYWHERE</span> Now turn around and look a mile in
              the other direction. You see a similar coffee cup, at exactly the
              same temperature. Coincidence? Maybe. But if you see a similar cup
              in every direction, you might want to look for another
              explanation.

            <p>
              <span>STILL NOT ENOUGH TIME</span> There has not been enough time
              to carry coffee cups from place to place before they get cold. But
              if all the coffee cups were somehow filled from a single coffee
              pot, all at the same time, that might explain their even
              temperature.

            <p>
              <span>INFLATION</span> solves this problem. The theory proposes
              that, less than a trillionth of a second after the Big Bang, the
              universe expanded faster than the speed of light. Tiny ripples in
              the violently expanding energy field eventually grew into the
              large-scale structures of the universe.

          <div>
            <img src="./assets/images/7.png" alt="" />
            <p>
              <span>FLUCTUATION</span> Astronomers have now detected evidence of
              these ancient fluctuations in swirls of polarized light in the
              cosmic background radiation, which is energy left over from the
              early universe. These are gravitational waves predicted by
              Einstein.

            <p>
              <span>EXPANSION</span> Returning to our coffee, imagine a single,
              central pot expanding faster than light and cooling to an even
              temperature as it expands. That is something like inflation. And
              the structure of the universe mirrors the froth and foam of the
              original pot.
